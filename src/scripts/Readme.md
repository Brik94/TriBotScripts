1. BriChompyHunting

- Ideas: To make chompy killing more efficient
Implement a queue. After I attack chompy for atleast 1 damage add chompy to queue, and attack other chompies until no more chompies appear.
Then proceed to attack the first chompy in the queue and remove after chompy dies.

Reasoning: After a chompie disappears it has a chance to disappear. If you can attack a chompy atleast 1 time (atleast 1 damage done)
then the compy will remain in the area. Also a chance to get practice with a Data Structure.
