# TriBotScripts
Scripts I've written for Tribot

1. PureChompyHunter (Complete)
- Work on CPU Efficiency (sleeps)
- Collect Feathers option. Collect raw chompy option > Different script need to add banking and pathing.
- Check if proper chompy hunting gear is equipped.
- Eventually create a nice Paint/GUI

2. Rogues Den Runner
Note: instead of continually creating myPos variable, create a method that will return my current position for efficiency.
